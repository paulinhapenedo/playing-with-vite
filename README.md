## Development Log

**March, 23 2024**
Start of the jorney! Decided to use Vite + React + TypeScript for the stack because it's been a while since I've worked outside the Next.js ecossystem. Installed eslint, Prettier, Vitest and React Testing Library.

Went with shadcn for components because of the aforementioned experience in the Next.js ecossystem, but that might change.


**March, 24 2024**
Decided for Neubrutalism for the design. It's a trend I'm really into in the last months because it stands out from the sea of Vercel/Apple-like futuristic approaches (I love purple and deep blue, but I'm done with those background gradients).
